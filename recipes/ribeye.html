    <h2>"The Perfect Ribeye"</h2>
    <p><strong>I hate recipes</strong>--<em>WAIT--</em>No I don't. That's poor expression on my part......I'm sorry. I don't at all hate recipes: in fact, I think recipes are extraordinary! 
        (No this isn't my inner glutton typing away--I promise). 
        The beauty of recipes to me lies in what they take on, what they embody; a seldom regarded but all-important practice: the preservation of discovered techniques that lead to wonderful results, the importance of which extending well beyond food.
        An example? The cement found in ancient Rome (*checks watch, "Dude, I'm here to cook a ribeye.") 
        I know, I know, just stay with me. 
        Despite being mixed over two millenials ago, cement from ancient Rome amazingly still holds, outlasting the present day mixtures we use by <s>decades</s>, <s>centuries</s>, <em><strong>millenials</em></strong>. 
        As it turns out, the Romans utilized a special mix of volcanic ash and seawater which causes a chemical reaction over time that strengthens the concrete. 
        Despite dogged attempts to replicate this method, modern engineers have had no such luck as sadly, the technique, or knowledge, wasn't effectively passed down: <em>How important it is to preserve effective techniques.</em>
        Even still, this discipline finds its roots in something deeper. 
        Nestled somewhere at the top of humanity is sitting down and sharing excelling knowledge with someone solely for the sake of their wellbeing: This is among the purest expressions of love, and recipes might be the paragon of such expressions; <em>Recipes are amazing!</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>But back to hate though because I DO hate recipes: I hate 99% of the ones found online.</p> 
        
    <p>Why? Think of the most basic food you can think of: scrambled eggs, grilled cheese, chicken salad, you name it. 
       Go on Google, enter that food and "recipe" in the search bar and brace for the browser's onslaught of a bajillion needlessly complex recipes that utilize a list of endless ingredients no one ever has on hand: "scRAmBleD EGgs wITh crEMe fReSH aNd GOUda"...</p>
    
    <p>Needlessly complex.</p> 
    
    <p>I'm a man of simple. Whereas most humans dread being termed a simpleton, such a snub would warm my heart. 
       And as a simpleton, I'm naturally drawn to things simple, recipes being no exception. 
       More specifically, simple recipes that produce wonderful results. 
       And since this is my webpage, that's exactly what I'm promoting today:
       <s>A</s><strong><em> THE</em> Grilled Ribeye Steak.</strong> 
       This recipe cooks fast-check-, is hard to mess up (The Ribeye's fat content makes it more forgiving than say a Strip)-check-, <s>is cheap</s>, and most importantly is <strong>absolutely delicious!</strong><em>-check</em>

    <H3>What You'll Need</H3>
    <h4> For the Steak</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>16-24oz Prime Ribeye</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black Peppercorns</li> 
    </ul>

            
    <h4>For the Herb Compound Butter</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Stick of Salted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of Fresh Cilantro finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Fresh Parsley finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Fresh rosemary finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 Tsp of MSG</li>
      <li>Sheet of Plastic Wrap</li>  
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4> For the Steak</h4>
    <p><strong>PREPARATION:</strong> Between 1-6 hours before grilling, 
       <strong>Dry Brine</strong> the steak by seasoning both sides generously with salt
       (Kosher is king) and resting it on a wire rack until dry and a dark red color. Add peppercorns right before cooking. Ready the grill.</p>
       <p><strong>COOKING:</strong> With the grill scorching, lay the steak on and press it down. Flip after 1 minute then repeat until 
       the external is a nice dark brown color--Usually 4 flips with a minute on each side. 
       </p>
       <p>Move the ribeye to the cool side of the grill and put the lid on. Let the steak rest on each side for 1 minute like this afterwhich
       remove the steak resting it again for 6+ minutes  on a wire rack (be sure to clean the wire rack if reusing the same one from the dry brine process).
       You should have a bomb steak at this point.</p>
    <h4>For the Herb Compound Butter</h4>
    <p><strong>PREPARATION:</strong> Get the stick of butter down to room temperature, unwrap (optional), and toss in a mixing bowl. 
       Add your cilantro, parsley, rosemary, and pepperflakes and stir until mixed. 
       Add salt if wanted. Lay down a sheet of plastic wrap and place contents in the middle, then tie the ends tightly and roll until a cylinderical shape takes form.
       Refridgerate until firm. Slice and place a piece on the steak while hot.</p>
