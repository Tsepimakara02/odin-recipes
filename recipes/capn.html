      <h2>A Recipe...for Cereal?</h2>
      <p>I already know what you're thinking: <em>"A recipe?...For CAP'N CRUNCH?...Is the author ok...?"</em>
      Two things. Firstly: Yes I'm ok! (kinda), And secondly: if you read on you might find this post isn't that ridiculous--or maybe you will...
      </p> 
      <h3>Look at this photo:</h3>
      <img src="https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2022/03/900x900/thali-feature.jpg" height="400" alt="An Indian Thali Meal" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <p>It's called an Indian Thali. Looks yummy right? What would you dig into first? The rice? The bread?
        The cauliflower? <em>"Ooohhh, it does look yummy, I'd pick the--"</em> WRONG! Indian Thali to the average American looks like a bunch of sides to dig into.
        However the array of foods are actually meant to be eaten together. So in theory, when eating Thali you should never run out of anything before <em>everything's</em> done.
        There are endless examples around the world of foods that are supposed to be eaten in a specifc way. Another's Ethiopian Injera (a spongy bread) with Wat (stew). Once again you'd
        sit down to your Injera and Wat and might tempted to just take a spoonful of Wat, or nibble on a piece
        of Injera independent of each other. However to locals, Injera isn't a side, it's a utensil, 
        a key part in the flavor delivery system. To locals, eating them separately would be missing the whole point.

      <p><em>"Buddy, all that's phenomenal--How does this apply to a bowl of cereal?"</em></p>
      <p>I'm glad you asked! </p>
      <p>Imagine you were born in rural Mynmar. Many a mornings you've had mohinga, so much so it's etched in your brain (you might even be sick of it by now).
         But that bright yellow box with weird characters and an unusally dressed man with a very large grey mustache: what's that?
         You might rip the bag open, wonder at it's contents, even try a few, then nothing more; No bowl, no spoon, no milk: how sad. 
         That's NO WAY for one's first encounter with diabetically sweet, ultra processed, labratory flavored corn to play out. 
         Thus, out of fear for the aforementioned happening ever, this recipe, or more like set of instructions was born. 
         More than a recipe/set of instructions, this post is a reminder to myself how often we forget
         and brush over those with rudimentary understanding levels. As a conscientious counter to this tendency, 
         this post was made as someone's guide to their very first encounter with this American breakfast staple 
         (Heck, show it to your 4-year old--And go with Lucky Charms as the introductory cereal: Trust me, their gonna flip), 
         so if you're a smarty pants who already knows how to prepare a bowl of cereal then you can click off--However, if you pour the milk then the cereal, seriously consider staying...
